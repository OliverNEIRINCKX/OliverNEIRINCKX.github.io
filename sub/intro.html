		A introduction that explains who I am.
		This is who I am.
		I like to do the things that I like.
		I don't like things that I don't like.
		I will tell you my qualities and my talents.
		I will tell you what I do.
		I will tell you what I did in the past.
		I have plans for the future.
		I hope you are inspired.
